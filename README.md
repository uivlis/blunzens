# blunzens-scrap
Uncensorable speech spider on BluzelleDB.

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your Google Perspective API key and BLZ mnemonic.
You must have a Google Perspective API key. To get one, visit https://www.perspectiveapi.com/#/home.
You must also have a BLZ wallet. To create one, visit https://staking.bluzelle.com/.

Run `npm install`.

## Usage

You should take advatnage of the comfortable umbrella of a VPN. Our suggestion is ProtonVPN. After sign-up and installation, don't forget to run:
```
sudo protonvpn c
```
before each run of the following instruction:
```
npm start
```
The spider should be running now. Let it crawl for a while, until it stops.
You can run `npm start` any time you wish to update the BluzelleDB.
